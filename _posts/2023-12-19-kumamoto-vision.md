The reports highlights how Kumamoto can support the Silicon Island Kyushu mission by offering stakeholders an ideal environment for the development of the semiconductor industry. 

It is likely that Kumamoto will welcome more investments in the near future following the construction of the TSMC fab in Kikuyo. 

### **Key take aways**
- **Strengthening the semiconductor supply chain**
    - Kumamoto needs to encourage all type of companies to do business in the prefecture. Pre-process, post-process, material. 
- **Ensuring a stable workforce**
  - Developing local human resources is crucial for building a thriving ecosystem. 
- **Building an innovation ecosystem**
    - DX or digitization is key for attaining a Society 5.0. 
    -  Semiconductor design is the current weakness of Kumamoto. 
    - Efforts should be made to align these new projects with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 



This document offers of good view of the challenges ahead to make Kumamoto a key player within the Silicon Island Kyushu and a leader within Japan.
