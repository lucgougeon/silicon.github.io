The workshop was dominated by the idea of collaboration and removing barriers in the creation of semiconductors. Strader Payton from the Fukuoka American Consulate encouraged the collaboration between the USA and Japan. 

### Efabless
Mohamed Kassem from [efabless](https://efabless.com/) opened the workshop by explaining that chip making needs to be simplified. More technical information on how ** efabless can be found on their GitHub page <https://github.com/efabless>

### Professor Murmann
Professor Boris Murmann from Hawaii University noted a shortage of chip engineer and pointed out the difficulties of accessing [EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation). These software are proprietary, expensive and protected by NDA.  
Professor Murmann insisted on the importance of quality documentation and standard of open source tools.

### Professor Koji Inoue
Professor [Koji Inoue](https://sites.google.com/view/kojiinoue-jp/) who also hosted the workshop explained the landscape of the Silicon Island Kyushu with a particular focus on activities conducted in Fukuoka. 
The Fukuoka Institute of System LSI Design Industry <https://lsi.ist.or.jp/> is capable of offering a complete learning experience in producing semiconductors. It was interesting to learn that they organized activities for children at Kidzania. 

### Bangfei Pan from Google AI
Bangfei Pan from Google AI presented the open source project Open Se Cura  which is a secure low power ambient perception and sensing system. <https://opensecura.googlesource.com>


### Andreas Olofsson
Andreas Olofsson from Zero Asic <https://zeroasic.com> presented his chiplet idea. His idea is to create the equivalent of Lego blocs with 2mmx2mm chiplets. 
- Chiplets are cheaper to produce
- His concept requires that chip production follow a standard. 
- Users can already test the functions of creating CMOS with his chiplets online. 

### Robert Mains from Chips Alliance
Robert Mains presented the work of the Chips Alliance <https://chipsalliance.org> which is a part of the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org)
The Chips Alliance wants to offer open source tools at all level. 

### Professor Ideda
Professor Makoto Ikeda from Tokyo University offered a good history of chip making education in Japan since 1996. <http://www.agile-x.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/>
He also described the effort to offer tools to all academics and business in Japan. <https://ai-chip-design-center.org>


### Andrew B Kahng from OpenRoad
Andrew B Kahng from UCSD  presented his OpenRoad project which was mentioned pretty much by all speakers. <https://theopenroadproject.org>
The project aims a making design accessible to all. 

### Dan Dechene from IBM
Dan Dechene described how 3D chip making and chiplet could pave the way to further innovation in semiconductors. 

### Johan Euphrosine from Google
The last speaker was Johan Euphrosine from Google. He explained that Google was trying to get some of their software experts to work in hardware. 
He shared a few resources including

### Conclusion

Open source solution can help working designers to collaborate more easily. Making the tools easily available can also greatly facilitate training the next generation and secure enough human resources for the semiconductor industry. 

English remains the lingua franca and it is important that Japanese students learn how to collaborate with researchers from around the world.
