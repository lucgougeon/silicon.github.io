Japan will offer digital nomads a new six-month visa from March 2024. Official procedures from the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/long/index.html
) have yet to be announced, but the visa requires a salary of 10 million yen from a foreign entity. 
Silicon Island Kyushu would naturally recommend the Island of Kyushu as the best bang for the buck, with Fukuoka and Kumamoto as prime destinations for the digital nomad. 

### Fukuoka

Fukuoka would be the perfect urban environment for people considering Tokyo and Osaka. It is considerably cheaper than Tokyo and Osaka and offers a cosmopolitan and vibrant city life. 
Fukuoka is also supporting startup entrepreneurs interested in the [startup visa](https://www.city.fukuoka.lg.jp/keizai/r-support/business/startupviza_2_2.html
). The city has numerous [co-working spaces](https://fukuokaeats.com/eats/bestcoworkingspaces
). 

### Kumamoto

If you are interested in a more laid-back environment, Kumamoto is located in the center of Kyushu, which allows for easy exploration of the rest of the island. Co-working space is available right in the center of the city.  The [Mirai Kaigishitsu](https://mirai-k.or.jp/ ) has two locations in downtown Kumamoto. 

Kumamoto is currently at the heart of the Silicon Island Kyushu, with the new TSMC fab opening in February 2024 and a second fab expected to open in 2027. 
The Kumamoto Airport, which was recently renovated, conveniently offers flights to Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. 

If you decide to come to Japan as a Digital Nomad, let's hope you will consider Kyushu as a destination.
